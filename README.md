Optimizing Portfolio Risk of Cryptocurrencies Using Data-Driven Risk Measures

For successful investments, risk management is crucial. Common risk measures in portfolio optimization include the standard deviation of portfolio returns, expected shortfall, and mean absolute deviation. 
Traditional approaches assume that data are normally distributed, leading to an underestimation of risk when incorporating volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies.
In this work, data-driven kurtosis-based risk measures and their superiority over traditional methods are demonstrated using portfolios with high-frequency stocks and cryptocurrency price data.
